# Readme
Website adapted from the [Avicenna theme](https://github.com/hadisinaee/avicenna) for Hugo. The Avicenna theme is in turn adapted from the [Academic theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-academic/).

My minor changes to the Avicenna theme include:

- disabled news feed, blog, and CV
- changed the Academia header to Education (edit: `themes/avicenna/layouts/partials/about/interests_academia.html`
- modified `/themes/avicenna/static/css/style.css`
    - modified the presentation of the education bullet points
    - modified the affiliation sections
    - changed the color scheme in themes/hugo-avicenna/styles/css/style.css

TODO
- add news section, for e.g.
https://www.eawag.ch/en/news-agenda/news-portal/news-detail/improved-health-check-for-running-waters/
- add projects
- change red color of headers in `style.css`
