This Hugo website is adapted from the [Avicenna theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/avicenna/) developed by Hadi Sinaee. The Avicenna theme is in turn adapted from the [Academic theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-academic/).

My minor changes to the Avicenna theme include:

- changed the Academia header to Education
- modified the presentation of the education bullet points
- modified the affiliation section
- changed the color scheme in themes/hugo-avicenna/styles/css/style.css
- disabled news feed, blog, and CV

TODO
- add news section
https://www.eawag.ch/en/news-agenda/news-portal/news-detail/improved-health-check-for-running-waters/
- add projects
- change red color of headers in `style.css`
