I am currently a quantitative ecologist at Stantec. Previously, I was a data scientist and aquatic ecologist at [Ecofish Research](https://www.ecofishresearch.com/).

Although I am an aquatic and statistical ecologist by training, in consulting I've worked as a data analyst/scientist, ecologist, and GIS specialist simultaneously. I've been involved in cumulative effects assessments, habitat suitability analyses, benthic and fish community analyses, stream temperature modelling, and many other types of projects requiring complex data analyses. 

I completed my PhD at ETH Zurich while working at Eawag (the Swiss Federal Institute for Aquatic Science & Technology). In my doctoral research, I applied statistical species distribution models (SDMs) to quantify how stream invertebrate and fish communities respond to natural and anthropogenic environmental conditions in Swiss rivers. In developing these SDMs, I deepened my knowledge of statistical modelling approaches and the model development process. I also gained experience in using multiple programming languages and GIS tools to process, analyze, and visualize a variety of environmental datasets and model results.

In my spare time, I enjoy the following hobbies:

* fly fishing (typically dry flies and 3WT setups)
* freshwater fish-keeping and aquascaping
* hiking and camping
* photography (macros, landscape, and vintage photography)
* everyday computing with Linux (currently using Arch, Kubuntu, and Raspbian Linux)
* home networking with Raspberry Pi and NAS server
