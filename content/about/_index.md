I am currently a data scientist and aquatic ecologist at [Ecofish Research](https://www.ecofishresearch.com/).

In 2020, I completed my PhD at ETH Zurich while working at Eawag (the Swiss Federal Institute for Aquatic Science & Technology). In my doctoral research, I applied statistical species distribution models (SDMs) to quantify how stream invertebrate and fish communities respond to natural and anthropogenic environmental conditions in Swiss rivers.

In developing these SDMs, I gained a foundational knowledge in statistical modelling approaches and the model development process. I also became proficient in using multiple programming languages (e.g., R, Python) and GIS software tools (e.g., ArcGIS, QGIS) to process, analyze, and visualize a wide variety of environmental datasets (biomonitoring data, land use data, etc) and model results.

Although I am broadly interested in ecological modelling and species distribution modelling, I am particularly interested in (i) applying Bayesian methods to quantify model uncertainty and the inference of species responses to environmental conditions, and (ii) using model-based analyses to derive practical recommendations for improving ecosystem monitoring, management, and conservation.

If I'm not processing data or developing models, I enjoy playing badminton, learning fly fishing, practicing photography, or experimenting with Linux or Raspberry Pi projects.
