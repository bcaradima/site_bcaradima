I am currently a data scientist and aquatic ecologist at [Ecofish Research](https://www.ecofishresearch.com/).

During my doctoral research at ETH Zurich, I applied statistical models and data analysis techniques to quantify how stream invertebrate and fish communities respond to natural and anthropogenic environmental conditions in Swiss rivers.

I am particularly interested in (i) applying Bayesian methods to quantify model uncertainty and uncertainty in species' responses to model inputs, and (ii) analyzing model results to derive practical recommendations for improving ecosystem monitoring, management, and conservation.

In developing these models, I process and analyze a wide variety of datasets using multiple programming languages (Python, R) and GIS software suites (ArcGIS, QGIS, and PostgreSQL/PostGIS), although I increasingly prefer R for the entire model development process. I am also a proponent of using free and open source software in the sciences to support reproducible scientific research.

If I'm not processing data or analyzing model results, I am usually playing badminton, fly fishing, practicing photography, or experimenting with Raspberry Pi projects.
